# Saudi Arabia Routes Network Analysis
In many real-world applications such as road navigation, network routing,
and logistics planning, finding the shortest path between two locations
is a fundamental problem.

## Notice

This project is an academic and analytical study intended for educational purposes.

The road network and distances used in this project are simplified and do not represent accurate measurements from reality or official transportation data.



## Description
The goal of this project is to model a map as a weighted graph where:
- Nodes represent locations.
- Edges represent roads.
- Edge weights represent distances or costs.

We apply Dijkstra’s Algorithm to compute the shortest path from a source
node to all other nodes in the graph, focusing on finding the optimal route
to a specific destination.

### Objectives:
- Represent a real-world problem as a graph.
- Apply Dijkstra’s algorithm correctly.
- Visualize the shortest path.
- Answer analytical questions based on the results.
